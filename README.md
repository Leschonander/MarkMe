Turning hackathon project at UVA.hacks into actual useable software. Mostly a personal project to build something with tech I am learning. Likely will clean it up somepoint and do something with it.

In index some code is deleted due to it involving information that i'd rather not let other people have. 

Built with:
  1. Express.js
  2. MongoDB + Mongoose
  3. semantic-ui

Link below is to what the input menu looks like at the moment.
